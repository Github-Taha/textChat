<h1>TextChat</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>TextChat is a Node JS based chatting website which allows you to make your own account and chat with other people. It has a login and signup page, as well as one chatting page.</p>
<h2>Making</h2>
<p>The website is made with Node JS and is a test project to design a texting language. Currently, it has a login page, where users can login using their credentials. If they don't have an account, they can sign up.</p>
<h2>Password</h2>
<p>The password isn't stored very well, only using sha-256 when a secure server is present. Currently, the hashing algorithm for the password isn't very secure. I have tried to use SHA-256 but it was giving me some problems. In the end, I am using a custom hashing algorithm.</p>
<h2>File Management</h2>
<p>The current file management is not good. When the client asks for some data, the server sends the entire file which contains some unnessesary information. This information can then be used to attain emails and passwords. I am thinking of ways to improve this. I can deniyng access to other files and only send important information instead of the entire file.</p>
<h2>Improvments</h2>
<p>There are many possible improvements. Here is a list of some.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Imporved UI</li>
  <li>The ability to delete your account</li>
  <li>Different chats</li>
  <li>A settings page</li>
  <li>A list where you have your chats</li>
  <li>More secure password storage</li>
  <li>Better file management</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more improvements that I can make.</p>
